We recommend following the guidelines below to increase your chances of getting your change accepted.

#### Code Guidelines ✨

- file naming convention: `filename.type.ts` e.g. `hello-world.component.ts`
- class naming convention: **PascalCase** -> `ExampleClass`
- function naming convention: **KebabCase** -> `exampleFunction`
- variable naming convention: **KebabCase** -> `exampleVariable` 
- Do **not** push code with `comments, refactor code if the complexity is to hight
- **Do not include swear words**

### Commands 🪁
#### Run server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
- abbreviation `ng g c hello-world` -> creates new component named `hello-world`

#### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

#### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
